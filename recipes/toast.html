        <p>
            Cinnamon baked French toast is one of those recipes you always want to keep in your back pocket. Hosting a holiday brunch? Feeding a load of hungry teens? Trying to impress distinguished house guests? Cinnamon baked French toast—it's one of those breakfast casseroles for every crowd and every occasion. Plus you can assemble it the night before and slide it into your oven the next morning. Ta-da! Breakfast is served.

            You can either make this a moist, bread pudding-like dish… or bake it a little longer for something crispier. You can also sprinkle on fruit before adding the crumb topping and even add chopped pecans to said crumb topping. Get creative! I like serving it with good, crispy bacon or breakfast sausage and a yummy fruit salad.
